                Hey guys, my name is Stevie Giron and I love to create. 
                That can mean writing and playing my songs on my guitar. Thinking
                of beats I can make which can be for any genre of music or even a 
                soundtrack to a movie. Also coming up with ideas for any future movie
                endeavors I would love to pursuit.
            </p>
